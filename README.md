# Challenge 3 - Crypto Arbitrage Opportunities

In this challenge I compared Bitcoin prices between two exchanges, Bitstamp and Coinbase, in 2018 and analyzed the pricing spreads to find arbitrage opportunities. I narrowed down my analysis to three seperate dates between 1/1/2018 and 3/31/2018 and provided insights to the opportunity for profit during these three days. 

To summarize, within this three month period there was a substantial arbitrage opportunity that was available for at least a day. This opporunity could have resulted in profits in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
